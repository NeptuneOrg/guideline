## Styleguides

#### Commit Messages Styleguide

We follow [The seven rules of a great git commit message](https://gist.github.com/julienbourdeau/e605e4b8b47da97c249a0f72598529c8). Please read them before commit.

#### JavaScript Styleguide

We follow [Javascript Standard](https://standardjs.com/)'s rules. Make sure `standard` does not detect any problem before commit. Else, you can fix mostly of them with `standard --fix`.
